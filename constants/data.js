      "An endlessly curious Senior Full Stack Developer with a strong background in High-Performance Financial Technology, Entrepreneurship and Social Change.",
    description: [
      `I did Computer Science at the University of Manchester, I then did a summer internship at Credit Suisse London during my second year of university. I was offered a job (and a bonus!) based on my performance and dropped off my Masters course to join the Technical Analyst Program after I graduated with a First Class B.Sc.`,
      `I worked in Electronic Bond Trading, connecting CS to a new Brokerage in New York using the FIX Protocol and Java, then moved to a Big-Data Team as the youngest Full Stack Developer in the company, doing Real-Time stream processing and dashboarding (Java, SpringBoot, React, Kafka, Cassandra) at terabytes-per-second scale for FX Risk Data.`,
      `In my spare time I made several Automated Crypto-Currency Trading Bots  and developed an addiction to Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, a Ground based Martial Art.`,
      `After a few years I got promoted to Assistant Vice President and moved to another Credit Suisse Team, Equity Derivatives IT. Working directly with Traders in Scala, a functional language, on the Real-Time Pricing. We were taking in data from markets and risk engines to adjust prices for each derivative.`,
      `The Covid Pandemic put things into perspective. I Decided to resign and forge my own path as an Entrepreneur, hoping to have a wider (and better) impact on the world then would be possible in an Investment Bank.`,
      `I used my own savings (and liquidated all my cryptocurrency) to found 3 bootstrapped buinesses, Humble Beeing - A social Enterprise, Afropocene StudioLab - An Art/Tech collective and DralegaWebOperations - A Web Agency that combines high performance websites with leading design.`,
      `It's been quite the journey! But I wouldn't have it any other way.`
